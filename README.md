# Predictive Analysis of Healthcare Data

## Overview
This project performs predictive analysis on a healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle to forecast patient outcomes. Key variables include demographics, medical history, and clinical measurements. The goal is to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient care strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises:
- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, etc.
- **Medical History**: Previous conditions and medications.
- **Clinical Measurements**: Vital signs and test results.
- **Outcome Variables**: Target variables indicating patient outcomes (e.g., readmission rates).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions and significant predictors.
3. **Model Development**: Applying various modeling techniques, including logistic regression and random forests.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The predictive model effectively forecasts patient outcomes, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making.

## Installation
To run the analysis, ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed. Install required packages using:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "forecst"))
